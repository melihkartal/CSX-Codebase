/*Now that we know what variables are, 
let's create one of our own. Below line 6, declare a variable named lastName 
and assign it the value of your last name. 
Make sure you wrap your name in quotation marks,
e.g. "Smith". Here's another example in case:

var myName = "Kyle";
console.log(myName) // => "Kyle"

Now, go back to line 1 and modify the value of firstName to be your first name. 
Uncomment the console.log statement on line 10 and run your code; 
you should see Jenny replaced by your 
first nameâ€”unless your first name is Jenny,of course.*/

var firstName = "Melih";
var lastName = "Kartal";

console.log(firstName);
console.log(lastName);
