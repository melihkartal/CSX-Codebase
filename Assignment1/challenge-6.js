// Challenge

// 1. Uncomment out lines 1 & 2. Hit the Run Code button. Notice how we are missing all those backslashes? Add the appropriate \'s so that the path prints to the console with the proper \'s where they belong.

// 2. Uncomment out lines 4 & 5. Hit the Run Code button. Uh Oh! We've got an error! Fix the heSaid string so that it doesn't throw and error and prints to the console properly.

// 3. Uncomment out lines 7 & 8. Hit the Run Code button. Uh Oh! Another error! Fix the sheSaid string so that it doesn't throw and error and prints to the console properly.

const path = "C:\\Users\\Win\\Files\\javascript.js";
console.log(path);

 const heSaid = "He said, \"Hey Foo!\"";
console.log(heSaid);

const sheSaid = 'My name ain't Foo!';
console.log(sheSaid);
