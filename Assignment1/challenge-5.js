// Strings are a data type in JavaScript. In short, they are bits of text written inside of quotation marks. You can use either single quotes ('), double quotes ("), or backticks (`) as quotation marks to wrap a string, as long as the opening and closing symbols match. They are particularly useful for any data or value that can be represented as plain text.

// Uncomment the text on lines 2 through 4 to see examples of strings.
// Challenge

// 1. On line 7, declare a variable mySingleString with single quotes ('), and set it's value to any string you like.

// 2. On line 8, declare a variable myDoubleString with double quotes ("'), and set it's value to any string you like.

// 3. On line 9, declare a variable myBackString with backticks (`), and set it's value to any string you like.

let mySingleString = 'a';

let myDoubleString = "aa";

let myBackString = `aaa`;




// Uncomment the line below to check your work!
console.log(mySingleString);
console.log(myDoubleString);
console.log(myBackString);
